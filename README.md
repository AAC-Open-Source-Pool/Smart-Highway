# Introduction
-	The Smart Highway Project is a futuristic and innovative initiative that aims to revolutionize traditional road infrastructure by integrating advanced technologies to enhance safety, efficiency, and sustainability. This concept envisions the development of highways that are not just routes for vehicular transportation but intelligent ecosystems capable of adapting to changing conditions and providing a range of services.

# Requirements
- Arduino uno:
- Is a flexible, and easy-to-use programmable open-source microcontroller board that can be integrated into a variety of electronic projects.
- Ultra sonic *2
- Is an instrument that helps in motion sensing  an object using ultrasonic sound waves.
- Servo motor
- Incorporates positional feedback in order to control the rotational or linear speed and position.
- LED(as required)
- Is a widely used standard source of light in electrical equipment.
- LDR
- LDRs (light-dependent resistors) are used to detect light levels
- Bread board
- Is used for building temporary circuits
- Wires
- Wire is a flexible metallic conductor, especially one made of copper, usually insulated, and used to carry electric current in a circuit

# Circuit Diagram
- Add some info about your circuit diagram(if any).

# Contribution 
**This section provides instructions and details on how to submit a contribution via a pull request. It is important to follow these guidelines to make sure your pull request is accepted.**
1. Your pull request, if accepted, will only be branched, but never be merged since Internet of Things deals with hardware materials.
2. Before choosing to propose changes to this project, it is advisable to go through the readme.md file of the project to get the philosphy and the motive that went behind this project. The pull request should align with the philosphy and the motive of the original poster of this project.
3. To add your changes, make sure that the programming language in which you are proposing the changes should be same as the programming language that has been used in the project. The versions of the programming language and the libraries(if any) used should also match with the original code.
4. Write a documentation on the changes that you are proposing. The documentation should include the problems you have noticed in the code(if any), the changes you would like to propose, the reason for these changes, and sample test cases. Remember that the topics in the documentation is strictly not limited to the topics aforementioned, but are just an inclusion.
5. Submit a pull request via [Git etiquettes](https://gist.github.com/mikepea/863f63d6e37281e329f8)
